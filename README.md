**Prac 01 journal** 

Had to reinstall VS studio and remember how to write HTML code from 3 years ago. this caused a bit of a headache for awhile. But with the power of Google and older uni work I could fall back on to look over I figured out how to create a basic dummy site, then import a bootstrap template. The hardest part was figuring out Github pages. at first it didn't like the file structure i had created. Once the index.html was in the first file with the assets in its own file everything just worked.

Once the initial content was uploaded Ii had to remember how to create links between .HTML pages. The lucky thing was that the template I had chosen had half of the code required and I could just fill in the blanks. Cloned the initial github content and pushed and commited the completed static site.
